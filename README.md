# Checksum-in-data-transmission
Program to implement the Checksum Generator on the Sender side and Checksum Checker on the Receiver side. 

Sample I/P and O/P:

Suppose that the sender wants to.

Input: Sender - 4 frames each of 8 bits, where the frames are 11001100, 10101010,
11110000 and 11000011

Receiver - Receive the same frame along with checksum

Output: No Error

Input: Sender - 4 frames each of 8 bits, where the frames are 11001100, 10101010,
11110000 and 11000011

Receiver the Frame 2 - 11101010

Output: Non Zero checksum and Error.
